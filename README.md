# SimpleMusicPlayer

Usage

Open the songs.csv file (SimpleMusicPlayer\bin\Debug\net6.0-windows) and add the name of the songs you want to listen to like this:

Skyrim - Music & Ambience - Night.mp3;
Dark Souls- Souls of Fire.mp3;

Then put the songs inside the same folder,

Finally you can open the .exe that is located in the bin folder
You can only put 10 songs in the list currently, I will be updating the functionality of the app on the go.
Enjoy! :)
