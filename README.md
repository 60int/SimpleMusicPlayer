# SimpleMusicPlayer

Usage

Open the songs.csv file (/Resources) and add the path of the songs you want to listen to like this:

C:\Songs\Skyrim - Music & Ambience - Night.mp3;
C:\Songs\Dark Souls- Souls of Fire (Slowed Down).mp3;

Now you can open the .exe that is located in the bin folder (SimpleMusicPlayer\bin\Debug\net6.0-windows)
You can only put 10 songs in the list currently, I will be updating the functionality of the app on the go.
Enjoy! :)
